### 10-Day ReactJS Learning Roadmap

This roadmap assumes you have basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The plan includes hands-on practice, so ensure you have a development environment set up with Node.js and a code editor like VS Code.

#### **Day 1: Introduction and Setup**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - What is React?
  - Advantages of using React
  - Setting up the development environment
  - Understanding JSX
  
- **Activities:**
  - Read about React and its core concepts.
  - Install Node.js and create-react-app CLI tool.
  - Create your first React application using create-react-app.
  - Write a simple component using JSX.

#### **Day 2: Components and Props**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Functional vs Class Components
  - Passing data with Props
  - Component composition

- **Activities:**
  - Create both functional and class components.
  - Pass data between components using props.
  - Build a small component tree with nested components.

#### **Day 3: State and Lifecycle**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - State management in components
  - Lifecycle methods in class components
  - useState Hook in functional components

- **Activities:**
  - Create components that use state to manage data.
  - Implement lifecycle methods in class components (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).
  - Use the useState hook to manage state in functional components.

#### **Day 4: Handling Events and Conditional Rendering**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Handling events in React
  - Conditional rendering techniques
  - Lists and keys in React

- **Activities:**
  - Add event handlers to components (click, change, etc.).
  - Implement conditional rendering with if statements, ternary operators, and logical &&.
  - Render lists of data using the map function and understand the importance of keys.

#### **Day 5: Forms and Controlled Components**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Creating forms in React
  - Controlled vs Uncontrolled components
  - Handling form submissions

- **Activities:**
  - Build a form with input fields.
  - Manage form data with controlled components (using state).
  - Handle form submissions and validation.

#### **Day 6: Context API and Hooks**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to Context API
  - Creating and using context
  - useEffect Hook

- **Activities:**
  - Create a context and use it to pass data through the component tree.
  - Use the useEffect hook for side effects (fetching data, subscriptions, etc.).
  - Build a small application that fetches and displays data from an API.

#### **Day 7: React Router**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to React Router
  - Setting up routing in a React application
  - Navigating between different routes
  - Using parameters in routes

- **Activities:**
  - Install and set up React Router.
  - Create multiple pages and navigate between them.
  - Use route parameters to create dynamic routes.

#### **Day 8: Styling in React**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Styling techniques (CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components)
  - Conditional styling
  - Responsive design in React

- **Activities:**
  - Apply basic CSS to your components.
  - Use CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styles.
  - Implement responsive design using media queries or responsive libraries.

#### **Day 9: State Management with Redux**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to Redux
  - Redux principles (actions, reducers, store)
  - Connecting Redux with React components

- **Activities:**
  - Set up Redux in your React application.
  - Create actions, reducers, and the Redux store.
  - Connect your components to the Redux store using react-redux.

#### **Day 10: Testing and Best Practices**
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to testing in React
  - Writing tests with Jest and React Testing Library
  - Best practices for React development

- **Activities:**
  - Set up Jest and React Testing Library in your project.
  - Write unit tests for your components.
  - Learn about best practices like component structure, naming conventions, and performance optimization.

#### **Post-Roadmap: Projects and Continuous Learning**
- **Build Projects:**
  - Create a personal portfolio using React.
  - Build a to-do app or a weather app to reinforce your learning.
  - Contribute to open-source React projects on GitHub.

- **Continuous Learning:**
  - Stay updated with the latest React features and updates.
  - Explore advanced topics like server-side rendering (Next.js), static site generation, and more.

By following this roadmap and engaging in hands-on practice, you'll gain a solid foundation in ReactJS and be well-prepared to build complex and efficient applications.
