Sure! Here's the **formatted explanation** of **React** as requested:

---

### 1 **Definition:**

**React** is an open-source **JavaScript library** used for building fast and interactive user interfaces, especially for **single-page applications (SPAs)**.
It is maintained by **Facebook** and allows developers to build reusable **UI components** that efficiently update and render when data changes.

---

### 2 **Features of React:**

* **Component-Based Architecture**
  UI is broken into independent, reusable pieces called components.

* **Virtual DOM**
  Improves performance by updating only the parts of the UI that change, instead of reloading the whole page.

* **One-Way Data Binding**
  Data flows in a single direction (from parent to child), making the application easier to debug.

* **JSX (JavaScript XML)**
  Lets you write HTML in JavaScript, making code easier to understand.

* **Declarative UI**
  You describe the UI, and React takes care of rendering and updating it efficiently.

* **React Hooks**
  Allows you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

* **React Native Support**
  Enables building mobile applications for iOS and Android using the same React code structure.

* **Strong Community & Ecosystem**
  Large number of tools, libraries, and community support make development faster and easier.

### 3 **Simple Example:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

**Usage:**

```jsx
<Welcome name="Akhil" />
```

This will render:

```
Hello, Akhil!
```
