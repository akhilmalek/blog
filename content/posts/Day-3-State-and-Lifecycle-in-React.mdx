Today, you’ll focus on understanding how to manage state within components and how to utilize lifecycle methods to handle different stages in the component’s life.

### Topics to Cover

1. **Understanding State:**
   - What is state in React?
   - How state differs from props.
   - When to use state.

2. **Using the `useState` Hook:**
   - Importing and using `useState` in functional components.
   - Setting initial state.
   - Updating state and triggering re-renders.
   - Handling multiple state variables.

3. **Event Handling:**
   - Handling user input to update state.
   - Common event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.).
   - Passing event handlers to child components.

4. **Lifecycle Methods:**
   - Understanding the component lifecycle.
   - Introduction to `useEffect` for managing side effects.
   - How to mimic traditional lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` with `useEffect`.

5. **State and Lifecycle in Class Components (Optional):**
   - State in class components.
   - Lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc.).

### Practical Tasks

1. **State Management:**
   - Create a simple counter app that increments or decrements a number when buttons are clicked.
   - Implement a form with controlled components where the state tracks input values (e.g., a simple login form).

2. **Lifecycle Management:**
   - Build a component that fetches data from an API when it mounts and cleans up (e.g., cancelling a subscription) when it unmounts.
   - Experiment with `useEffect` to update the document title with the current state value.
