#### **Objectives:**
- Understand what React is and why itâ€™s popular.
- Set up your development environment.
- Create your first React application.
- Learn the basics of JSX.

#### **Topics Covered:**
1. **What is React?**
   - Overview of React.
   - Key features and advantages.
   - Understanding the virtual DOM.

2. **Setting Up the Development Environment**
   - Installing Node.js and npm.
   - Setting up a code editor (VS Code recommended).
   - Creating a React app using `create-react-app`.

3. **Understanding JSX**
   - What is JSX?
   - Differences between JSX and HTML.
   - Embedding expressions in JSX.

#### **Activities:**

1. **Read About React:**
   - [React Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
   - [Introduction to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

2. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   - Go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download and install the LTS version.

3. **Set Up Your Code Editor:**
   - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Install useful extensions like ESLint, Prettier, and the ReactJS code snippets.

4. **Create Your First React App:**
   - Open your terminal and run the following commands:

     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-first-app
     cd my-first-app
     npm start
     ```

   - This will create a new React application and start the development server.

5. **Write a Simple JSX Component:**
   - Open `src/App.js` and replace its content with:

     ```jsx
     import React from 'react';

     function App() {
       const name = "Aakhil";
       return (
         <div>
           <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
         </div>
       );
     }

     export default App;
     ```

   - This will render a simple greeting on the page using JSX.

#### **Review:**
- Ensure you understand the basics of what React is and how it works.
- Confirm that you have a working development environment with Node.js, npm, and VS Code.
- Familiarize yourself with creating and running a React application.
- Practice writing and understanding basic JSX.

By the end of Day 1, you should have a solid foundation for continuing your journey with React.
